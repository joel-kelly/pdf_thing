- Add a button to the top of the UI (next to the "PDF Tool" text currently) to open another PDF while a PDF is currently loaded
- Rename "PDF Tool" in the extension to "PDF Thing"
- Fix signature tool
  - Signatures are not placed in the selected location
  - After the signature is placed, the PDF is reloaded to a different page/position
  - It would be nice to be able to tweak the format of the timestamp 
  
- Investigate best practices for contributing to FireFox add-ons. Can I distribute these with those pdf tools included in it? Or is this better off as a website?
